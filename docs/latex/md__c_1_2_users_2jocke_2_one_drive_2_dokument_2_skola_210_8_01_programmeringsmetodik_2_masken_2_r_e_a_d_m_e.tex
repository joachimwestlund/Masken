A snake clone written in C for educational purposes by Joachim Westlund.

It is coded with \href{https://www.codeblocks.org}{\texttt{ Code\+::\+Blocks IDE}}

It won\textquotesingle{}t compile on Linux because the use of itoa() function that is not in the ANSI C standard. But that can easily be changed with snprintf() function. But I will not do it now. I\textquotesingle{}m sure there are other things too.

\href{https://www.libsdl.org}{\texttt{ Simple Direct\+Media Layer (SDL2)}} is used for various things.

\doxysection*{How to play\+:}

{\bfseries{From the start screen}}

Press space to play.

At any time you can hit ESC-\/key to go back.

At any time you can change music with keys 1-\/5, or silence with the 0-\/key.

{\bfseries{In game\+:}}

Use arrow keys to move the snake around. You are not allowed to hit the walls or yourself with the head of the snake.

You can \"{}eat\"{} the apple that is somewhere on the play field. Your snake will grow in the direction you came from. The apple has a random score associated with it and your snake will grow that many sections when \"{}eating\"{}. It will grow instantly so if you grow into a wall the game is over.

Every 30 seconds the game will speed up until a certain point.
